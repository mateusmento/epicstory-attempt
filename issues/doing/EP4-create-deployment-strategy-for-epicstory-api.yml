      I'm having some issues with regards to build a docker image for epicstory api. I'm getting an
      error and executing `npm ci` command in the Dockerfile.

      I was able to fix the problem in the previous comment by add command in Dockerfile to install
      python3 and other dependencies
      ```Dockerfile
      RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install python3 make g++ -y
      ```

      Now I'm having a problem when running a script to build and run a docker image on ec2 instance.
      It seems to be cloning the repository and installing docker but the image is being built.
      I ssh into the instance and check that no image is built. Needs some investigation.
      Some error occurs in the ec2 user data script and I can't even see it.
