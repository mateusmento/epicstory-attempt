      I'm having some issues with regards to build a docker image for epicstory api. I'm getting an
      error and executing `npm ci` command in the Dockerfile.

      I was able to fix the problem in the previous comment by add command in Dockerfile to install
      python3 and other dependencies
      ```Dockerfile
      RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install python3 make g++ -y
      ```
