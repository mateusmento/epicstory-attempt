  Although the deployment strategy is being able to build the infrastructure for deploying the epicstory-api
  by leverage the automation of terraform, it is still manual since I have to execute a terraform command.
  Also to build the application a docker image is being built and store inside the deployment ec2 instance
  instead of in separate locations where it can be built and store independently.
  
  I want to introduce a CI/CD pipeline where a docker image is built for the application, stored in a image
  registry and deployed into a ec2 instance where the image is run.

  A few options I already have in mind. For the image registry Dockerhub and AWS ECR are two good options.
  For the CI/CD pipeline I could use either Github Actions or CodePipeline. I see that AWS have other related
  services such as CodeBuild, CodeComment and CodeDeploy as well.
